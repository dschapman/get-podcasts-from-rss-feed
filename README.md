# Get Podcasts From RSS Feed
A crude node command line program that takes an RSS feed link and downloads all the files linked in it.

## Assumptions
This script assumes that it's a podcast RSS feed and renames all of the files to be `<date>-<slugified-title>.mp3`.

## Usage
To use this script run `node index.js` in the terminal.
